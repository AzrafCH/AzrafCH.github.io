I have always had interests that did not directly deal with code and programming but it was easy to draw parrellels between what I was interested in at the time and code. Wether those interest may have been shown as starkly contrasted on the surface, the approach to concepts in code were interwoven within the context of those interests.

I always had interests in building and creating things, wether it be new sounds for music, designing concepts or discussing ideas for buildings, rooms, spaces or furniture. In a nutshell i want to express my ideas, show people a new perspective to finding a new way of approaching something. I want them to think. And i also wish to think, I want to form a discussion through a medium. I want to connect through that medium. 

When I say medium, I mean a vehicle. At first my medium of expression was art in any form like sculpture, or painting.  As my interests changed, so did my medium. It soon deviated towards functionality, I wished to form discussion with how I view spaces, spaces turned to rooms, and those rooms then turned into whats inside those rooms and what was outside those rooms, what lived within those rooms, those objects of function whether it be chairs or a coffee machine that took up half the counter space, the materials that made up the floors and walls. In a subject matter that seemed so infinite in deviation, over time, grew into finite conclusions. 

That is when i chose to discover new areas of interests, in which i can express my medium without having a limit as to what can be achieved or to not create a misunderstanding of similarity of my own ideas compared to others. This led me to accessing code and programming. Where the entire subject was not an ocean with borders, or a container. It is alot of containers, an infinite amount of containers that can be melded together to create an infinite number of ways to express and explore an infinite number of my own medium(s). I no longer have such limitations or rules as i had done before with past interests, I can merge those distinct interests together. Code is not a seperate interest, or idea, or subject. Its within everything. It is the bridge, it is the connection, it builds the discussion, it is my medium.
